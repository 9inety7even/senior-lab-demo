TJHSST 2015 Senior Lab Demo
===========================
This code is meant to demonstrate one of the main deals behind our senior project, the combination of a WSGI server, in this case Flask, and WebSockets, in this case handled by Tornado. The main page is served by Flask, and the ping-pong is taken care of by Tornado.
